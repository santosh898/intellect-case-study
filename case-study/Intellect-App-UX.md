### Improvements

It would be nice to navigate to the next field using the keyboard.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/age-popup.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

It would be helpful to have the option to cancel the popup and highlight current selected value.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/security.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

This popup was introduced abruptly and are too technical. Affirmation that i can revisit this is missing.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/progress-0.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">
<img src="screenshots/progress-1.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">
<img src="screenshots/progress-2.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

The progress bar is inconsistent everywhere.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/search-results.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

Search results are often irrelevant.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/radio.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">
<img src="screenshots/checkbox.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

It's difficult to distinguish between radio buttons and checkboxes without understanding them through context.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/your-goals.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

The "Your Goals" section suddenly uses a different style.

what does "completing a goal" mean? How do I decide that?
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/insights-1.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

It took me very long to understand that the "mood tracking" feature is called Insights. If Insights CTA's illustration show the easily recognizable mood illustrations it would've been easy to find.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<img src="screenshots/insights-2.jpeg" alt="Feature 1" height="300">

I cannot click on the mood button of the day in the above screen to open the Check-in Details. Had to figure out by brute force to get to this screen.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The "Connect to SOS Support" feature can be improved as it seems to be using a WebView and that fact is evident.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The home page is cluttered with too many CTAs as a new user i was confused as to which feature to use first. May be a better "division of concerns" approach need to be applied for the homepage layout.
